# Deciding if you want to join

We are just a group of people who love D&D and want to help out the ecosystem with useful tools for DMs and Players alike.

We focus mainly on C# and .NET, but most of us love to explore, so the range of technologies being used can vary wildly from project to project.

If you love D&D, want to help the community, and are skilled enough, we would love to have you. 

We welcome anyone who is interested to reach out and see if this project is something they are interested in helping with.
